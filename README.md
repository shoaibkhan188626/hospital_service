## üéØ Overview

The **Hospital Service** is a core microservice within the **Connected Healthcare Ecosystem**. Its primary responsibility is to manage all hospital-related data, providing a centralized, secure, and reliable source of truth for other services, such as the User Service or Appointment Service.

Built with a modern stack (Node.js, Express, MongoDB), it is designed for scalability, security, and compliance with critical healthcare regulations like the **NDHM (National Digital Health Mission)**, **DPDP Act (Digital Personal Data Protection Act)**, and **Telemedicine Guidelines**. All inter-service communication is authenticated using a shared `SERVICE_KEY` to ensure a secure internal network.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Secure endpoints to create, read, update, and soft-delete hospital records.
- **Data Validation**: Validates `hospitalId` to ensure data integrity when other services (e.g., User Service) link doctors or staff to a hospital.
- **Robust Security**:
  - **Service-to-Service Authentication**: Protects all endpoints with a `SERVICE_KEY`.
  - **Common Vulnerability Protection**: Uses `helmet` to set crucial security headers.
  - **Rate Limiting**: Defends against brute-force attacks (100 requests per 15 minutes).
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Employs `winston` for detailed audit and error logs, crucial for compliance and debugging.
- **Offline-First Capability**: Designed to function with a local MongoDB instance, ensuring development and testing can occur without constant cloud connectivity.
- **Containerized**: Fully containerized with Docker for consistent development, testing, and production environments.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- MongoDB (local instance or a cloud provider like Atlas)
- Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shoaibkhan188626/hospital_service.git
    cd hospital-service
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables**:
    *Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example file.*
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    *Edit the `.env` file with your specific configurations (database URI, service key, etc.).*
    ```bash
    nano .env
    ```

4.  **Run the server**:
    - For development (with hot-reloading via `nodemon`):
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```
    - For production:
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```

5.  **Verify the service is running**:
    *Access the health check endpoint.*
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8082/health
    # Expected response: {"status":"UP"}
    ```

---

## üê≥ Docker Setup

Get the service running in a container with just a few commands.

1.  **Build the Docker image**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t hospital-service .
    ```

2.  **Run the container**:
    *This command runs the container and passes the environment variables from your `.env` file.*
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8082:8082 --env-file .env hospital-service
    ```

3.  **Using Docker Compose**:
    *For a more streamlined experience, especially when connecting to a database container.*
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Request Flow

The service follows a standard layered architecture to separate concerns, making it clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.

### Request Lifecycle Flowchart

Here‚Äôs a visual representation of how an incoming API request is processed:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Client"
        A[Other Microservice / API Client]
    end

    subgraph "Hospital Service"
        B{Express Router}
        C[Logging Middleware]
        D[Auth Middleware]
        E[Validation Middleware]
        F[Controller]
        G[Service Logic]
        H[Mongoose Model]
        I[MongoDB Driver]
    end

    subgraph "Database"
        J[(MongoDB)]
    end

    A -- HTTP Request --> B
    B -- /api/hospitals/:id --> C
    C -- Log Request --> D
    D -- Verify SERVICE_KEY --> E
    E -- Validate Params/Body --> F
    F -- Calls Service --> G
    G -- Business Logic --> H
    H -- Formats Query --> I
    I -- Executes CRUD --> J
    J -- Returns Data --> I
    I -- Returns Result --> H
    H -- Returns Formatted Data --> G
    G -- Returns to Controller --> F
    F -- Sends JSON Response --> A
```

> **Flow Explained**:
> 1.  An **HTTP Request** from a client (like the User Service) hits the **Express Router**.
> 2.  The request passes through a chain of **Middlewares**: first for **Logging**, then **Authentication** (validating the `SERVICE_KEY`), and finally for **Input Validation**.
> 3.  If all checks pass, the request reaches the appropriate **Controller**, which orchestrates the response.
> 4.  The **Controller** calls the **Service** layer, which contains the core business logic.
> 5.  The **Service** uses the **Mongoose Model** to interact with the **MongoDB** database.
> 6.  The data flows back through the layers, and the Controller sends the final **JSON Response** to the client.

## üõ£Ô∏è API Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/hospitals`.

| Method   | Endpoint | Description                | Auth Required    |
| :------- | :------- | :------------------------- | :--------------- |
| `POST`   | `/`      | Create a new hospital.     | ‚úÖ `SERVICE_KEY` |
| `GET`    | `/:id`   | Get a hospital by its ID.  | ‚úÖ `SERVICE_KEY` |
| `PATCH`  | `/:id`   | Update a hospital's details. | ‚úÖ `SERVICE_KEY` |
| `DELETE` | `/:id`   | Soft-delete a hospital.    | ‚úÖ `SERVICE_KEY` |

### Example: Create a Hospital

**Request**: `POST /api/hospitals`

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/api/hospitals \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_SERVICE_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "name": "City General Hospital",
        "address": "123 Health St, Wellness City",
        "contactNumber": "123-456-7890",
        "location": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [-73.987, 40.748]
        }
      }'
```

**Success Response (201 Created)**:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "_id": "60d5f1f77c3d4a001f8e8b5a",
        "name": "City General Hospital",
        "address": "123 Health St, Wellness City",
        "contactNumber": "123-456-7890",
        "location": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [-73.987, 40.748]
        },
        "isActive": true
    },
    "message": "Hospital created successfully"
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Compliance

- **NDHM**: Ensures interoperable data standards and maintains detailed audit logs for all data modifications.
- **DPDP Act**: Implements data minimization principles, uses soft deletes instead of permanent deletion, and ensures all data is securely stored.
- **Telemedicine Guidelines**: Provides a reliable mechanism for validating hospital data, which is essential for verifying doctor and practitioner affiliations.
- **General Security**:
  - **Authentication**: All endpoints are protected and require a valid `SERVICE_KEY` passed as a Bearer Token.
  - **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting requests to 100 per 15 minutes per IP.
  - **Secure Headers**: Uses `helmet` to protect against common web vulnerabilities like XSS and clickjacking.
  - **CORS**: Configured to only allow requests from trusted origins in a production environment.

---

## üß™ Testing

The project uses **Jest** for unit and integration testing, with **MongoMemoryServer** to create an in-memory database for each test run. This ensures tests are fast, reliable, and don't require a separate database connection.

1.  **Run all tests**:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

2.  **Run tests in watch mode**:
    ```bash
    npm run test:watch
    ```

3.  **Test Coverage**:
    *Our goal is to maintain >90% test coverage for all critical business logic.*
    ```bash
    npm run test:coverage
    ```
